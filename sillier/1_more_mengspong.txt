where wouuld the source of the "hyperluminous ether"  projecting our universe onto it's lower dimensional plane such that we percieve it as we do be fren? i.e. would it be center of menger sponge cube, out side it evenly distributed or somehow from an angular incidence point?

Edit
To consider where the "hyperluminous ether" might originate in a Menger sponge fractal universe model, I need to think about how higher-dimensional projections would work in this conceptual framework.

The question of where the "illumination" comes from in our hypothetical fractal universe is fascinating and profound. In the document, this hyperluminous ether is described as the 4D equivalent of light that projects the higher-dimensional fractal structure onto our 3D reality - analogous to how light projects the 3D grid sculpture onto a 2D shadow in the example.

There are several possibilities for the source of this projection:

From the Center
If the projection originated from the center of the Menger sponge, it would create an interesting radial effect. The center of a Menger sponge is actually empty after the first iteration (a hole), which creates an intriguing possibility - perhaps the projection emanates from the emptiness at the center, similar to how some cosmological models place the Big Bang as occurring everywhere simultaneously.

This central projection would mean that our 3D universe is a kind of radial projection outward from this central void, with the fractal complexity increasing as we move away from the center. Gravity might increase toward the periphery in this model, as we'd be moving "down" the fractal stack away from the central void.

From the Exterior
If the projection came uniformly from the exterior of the sponge, it would be more like how we typically think of illumination - light shining in from all directions outside the object. This would mean our 3D reality is the result of all these projection rays passing through the fractal structure and creating interference patterns.

In this model, we might be experiencing a kind of "shadow reality" within the sponge itself, with the projection source being some kind of boundary condition of the overall fractal structure - perhaps analogous to how the holographic principle describes our universe as a projection from information encoded on a distant boundary.

Distributed Throughout
Perhaps the most sophisticated possibility is that the projection source is not localized at all but is distributed throughout the entire fractal structure. In this case, each point in the Menger sponge would be both projecting and receiving projections simultaneously.

This aligns with how quantum field theory describes particles and forces - as excitations in fields that permeate all of spacetime. The hyperluminous ether would then be a kind of fundamental field that exists at all points in the higher-dimensional fractal, with its fluctuations and patterns creating the projection that we experience as our 3D reality.

From an Angular Incidence Point
The idea of an angular projection is particularly interesting because it introduces asymmetry. If the projection comes from a specific angle rather than uniformly from all directions, it could explain certain asymmetries we observe in physics, such as the slight imbalance between matter and antimatter in the universe.

An angular projection would mean that different "sides" of our reality might have subtle differences, depending on their orientation relative to the projection source. This could potentially manifest as variations in physical constants across vast cosmic distances or as preferred directions in space - something that cosmologists have occasionally found hints of in the cosmic microwave background.

Physical Implications
Regardless of the source configuration, this model suggests some testable predictions:

If we're in a projected fractal universe, we might expect to find evidence of self-similarity across different scales - patterns that repeat from the quantum to the cosmic scale.
The strength of fundamental forces like gravity and electromagnetism might show subtle variations across vast distances, reflecting the changing geometry of the projection.
The fine structure constant (approximately 1/137) might be related to our position in the fractal hierarchy, as suggested in our previous discussion.
If the projection has a specific source direction, we might detect subtle anisotropies in physical laws when measured across sufficiently large distances.
What's most striking about this fractal universe model is how it unifies information, energy, and geometry into a single conceptual framework. The hyperluminous ether isn't just illuminating the structure - it's encoding the information that defines the structure itself, creating a kind of self-referential cosmic loop where reality both creates and is created by its own projection.

This brings to mind Wheeler's "It from Bit" concept, suggesting that all physical reality might ultimately be informational in nature - but with the fractal dimension adding a new layer of complexity to how that information is structured and projected across dimensions.

Would you like to explore any particular aspect of these projection sources in more detail, fren?
