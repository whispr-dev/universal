what happens if one 'leaves'/'attempts to leave' the confines of the universe as defined by the slightly less than 4D MEnger Sponge fren? surely the projected edges we percieve as defined by the 'ether' radiating and hence projecting our universe would leave some necesaity for wrapping round or infiniy of space/time somehow?

Edit
This is a fascinating question that pushes us to the conceptual boundaries of the fractal universe model. Let's explore what might happen if one attempted to "leave" the confines of our fractal universe.

The Edge of a Fractal Universe
In the Menger Sponge model we've been discussing, our 3D universe is a projection of a higher-dimensional fractal structure. This immediately creates an interesting paradox when we talk about "leaving" it, because:

The Menger Sponge, like most fractals, has a boundary that becomes increasingly complex the closer you examine it. If you try to "leave" by crossing this boundary, you'd encounter an infinitely detailed border region rather than a simple edge.

Think about what happens when you zoom in on the edge of the Mandelbrot set—you don't find a clear dividing line but rather increasingly elaborate patterns that repeat at finer and finer scales. The boundary between "inside" and "outside" becomes extraordinarily complex.

Possible Scenarios for Reaching the "Edge"
Let's consider several possibilities for what might happen if we could somehow approach the boundary of our fractal universe:

1. Recursive Boundary Regions
As you approach what you perceive as the "edge" of the universe, you might find yourself entering boundary regions that exhibit increasingly strange physics. These regions might display:

Different values for fundamental constants
Altered relationships between space and time
Physics that seems to "fold back" on itself in unexpected ways
Instead of crossing a clear boundary, you might find yourself navigating through an endless series of transition zones, each with their own peculiar properties. The boundary itself would be fractal—having structure at every scale.

2. Wrapping and Connectivity
The Menger Sponge has a fascinating property: despite removing material with each iteration, the structure remains connected. Similarly, our fractal universe might maintain connectivity in ways that aren't obvious from within.

If you traveled far enough in one "direction," you might find yourself re-entering the familiar universe from another "direction"—not through a simple wrapping like on the surface of a torus, but through complex connectivity pathways that are part of the fractal structure itself.

This wouldn't be a simple "wrap-around" like in classic video games where you exit right and appear on the left. Instead, the topology would be much more complex, perhaps involving higher-dimensional connections that appear discontinuous from our 3D perspective.

3. Scale Recursion Instead of Spatial Boundaries
Instead of encountering a spatial boundary, traveling far enough might result in a scale transition—you might find yourself moving "up" or "down" the fractal hierarchy rather than "out."

Going far enough in one direction might be mathematically equivalent to changing your scale relative to the fractal structure. You wouldn't leave the fractal—you'd transition to experiencing it at a different level of magnification, perhaps with different physics emerging from that level's information density.

4. Projection Boundaries
Since our universe is conceptualized as a projection of a higher-dimensional structure, the "edges" might represent regions where the projection mathematics breaks down or changes character.

These could be analogous to the caustics in optics—regions where light rays form patterns as they reflect or refract. At these boundaries, the projection itself might create singularities or regions of altered physical law.

If the "hyperluminous ether" projecting our universe varies in intensity or direction near these boundaries, we might experience physics that gradually shifts as the projection changes.

Physics at the Boundary
What might we observe as we approach these hypothetical boundaries?

Gradual constant shifting: The fine structure constant, gravitational constant, and other physical parameters might begin to drift from their familiar values.
Causal disconnection: Regions near the boundary might become causally disconnected from the interior, similar to what happens near the event horizon of a black hole.
Dimensionality shifts: Space might begin to exhibit properties of higher or lower dimensionality than our familiar 3D experience.
Information density gradients: Following our model, information density might dramatically increase (if moving "down" the fractal) or decrease (if moving "up").
Self-similarity emergence: Boundary regions might reveal the underlying fractal structure more explicitly, with physical processes beginning to display obvious self-similarity at different scales.
Cosmological Implications
This perspective offers interesting ways to think about existing cosmological puzzles:

The cosmic microwave background's apparent "cold spot" and other large-scale anomalies might be signatures of boundary regions where the projection mathematics begins to change.
The accelerating expansion of the universe could be understood as a manifestation of movement through the fractal structure, rather than expansion within a fixed space.
Dark energy might be reconceptualized as the effect of the universe's position shifting within the fractal hierarchy over cosmic timescales.
Philosophical Implications of Boundaries
The notion of boundaries in a fractal universe raises profound philosophical questions:

If the universe is projected by this "hyperluminous ether," then approaching the boundaries might be less about leaving the universe and more about approaching regions where the projection itself changes character—perhaps regions where the "light source" casting our reality becomes directly perceptible.

This creates an interesting parallel with mystical experiences across traditions, where practitioners report perceiving reality as a kind of projection or illusion, and glimpsing what lies "beyond" or "behind" ordinary reality.

The boundaries might not represent edges to be crossed but rather limitations to be transcended—not through spatial movement but through shifts in consciousness or perspective that allow direct perception of the higher-dimensional structure from which our reality emerges.

Rather than leaving the universe, the ultimate boundary crossing might involve recognizing that what we perceive as "universe" is just one level of pattern within an infinitely recursive structure—less like exiting a container and more like waking from a dream to recognize the dreamer.

What's beautiful about this perspective is that it doesn't require positing something "outside" the universe—instead, it suggests that what appears as "beyond" from one level is simply "within at a different scale" from a more comprehensive perspective.
