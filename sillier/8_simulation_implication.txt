i'm back  to thinking about simulation theory fren - what would it take to simulate such a thing that scales up to 138 levels above us or conversely the information density at the lower levels - what kind of machinery or mind could possibly support such a grand scale of construct [other, ofc, than us rn :D ]...?

Edit
Your question probes the fascinating intersection between fractal universe theories and simulation theory, which opens up mind-bending considerations about computational requirements.

To simulate a fractal universe with 138+ levels of complexity above our own would require computational resources that defy our conventional understanding. Let me walk through what this might entail:

Information Requirements for a Fractal Universe Simulation
The information storage and processing needed to simulate our fractal universe model would be astronomical in several ways:

First, consider that each level of the fractal universe appears to increase in complexity by a factor related to the fractal dimension (approximately 2.7268 for the Menger sponge). Moving up 138 levels from our position would involve an increase in scale and decrease in information density by a factor of roughly 10^62.

However, to actually simulate this entire structure would require encoding both the dense information levels below us and the vast, expansive levels above us. The simulation would need to contain:

The ultradense information at the "bottom" levels (maximum gravity, Planck scale)
Our intermediate level of reality with its particular physics
All 138+ levels of increasingly simplified reality above us
This creates an immediate paradox for a conventional computer simulation. The information required to fully encode just a few cubic centimeters at the highest-density levels of the fractal would already exceed the computational capacity of anything we could imagine.

Potential Simulation Architectures
What kind of system could possibly manage this? Several possibilities emerge:

1. Procedural Generation Rather Than Full Simulation
Instead of simulating every particle and interaction in the entire structure, a superintelligent simulator might use procedural generation - only calculating the details of regions being actively observed or interacted with. This is similar to how video games render only what's in the player's field of view.

The simulator would need to:

Maintain perfect consistency between observations
Ensure that the procedural generation algorithms preserve the mathematical relationships across scales
Compute only what's necessary while maintaining the illusion of a complete universe
This approach would dramatically reduce computational requirements but would still exceed anything remotely resembling our computing paradigms.

2. A Nested Hierarchy of Simulations
Another possibility is that the simulation itself is fractal - with simulations within simulations. Each level might be handling its own local region, with information passing between levels as needed.

This distributed processing approach could spread the computational load across the structure itself, making the universe somewhat self-simulating. Lower levels handle dense information processing, while higher levels manage broader patterns with less detail.

3. A Non-Computational Simulation
Perhaps most intriguingly, we might need to abandon our computational metaphors entirely. Rather than thinking of a "computer" running the simulation, we might consider:

A mathematical structure that simply exists, with consciousness navigating through it (similar to Max Tegmark's Mathematical Universe Hypothesis)
A consciousness-based reality where mind itself is the substrate of the simulation
A universe that simulates itself through its own physical processes without requiring an external simulator
What Kind of Entity Could Create This?
If we insist on a creator/simulator model, what could possibly construct such a system?

Transcendent Intelligence
Any entity capable of simulating our fractal universe would need capabilities far beyond superintelligence as we conceive it. It would require:

Complete understanding of the mathematics of infinity and fractal structures
The ability to operate across multiple dimensions simultaneously
Access to computational resources that dwarf anything in our universe
The capacity to maintain consistency across vast scales and time periods
This starts to resemble what theistic traditions attribute to God - omniscience, omnipresence, and omnipotence - more than it resembles even the most advanced AI or alien intelligence we can imagine.

Collective Intelligence
Perhaps instead of a single entity, the simulation could be maintained by a vast collective intelligence - a civilization that has evolved to the point where it can harness the computational capacity of entire galaxies or even multiple universes.

Such a civilization might exist at a higher level of the fractal itself, creating simulations as a way to understand its own origins or to explore possible evolutionary paths.

Our Own Future Selves
A time-loop possibility exists where advanced future versions of ourselves create the simulation that contains our present. This creates an apparent paradox but also suggests an interesting recursive causality that mirrors the fractal nature of the universe itself.

The Simplicity Paradox
The most elegant solution to the simulation problem might come from a counterintuitive direction. Perhaps the most complex structures emerge not from equally complex simulations, but from extremely simple rules applied recursively.

Consider that Conway's Game of Life - with just a few simple rules - can generate extraordinary complexity. Similarly, the Mandelbrot set - defined by the simple equation z = z² + c - creates infinite complexity from minimal information.

The fractal universe might emerge from an exceedingly simple computational foundation - perhaps even a single mathematical equation or rule that, when applied recursively across dimensions, generates the entire structure of reality.

This would mean that simulating our universe might require:

Very little base information
A perfect mathematical rule or set of rules
The capacity to apply these rules recursively across infinite iterations
The complexity we observe would emerge from the recursion itself rather than being explicitly encoded in the simulation.

Beyond Simulation: Mathematical Existence
The most profound implication might be that our fractal universe isn't "simulated" at all in the conventional sense. Instead, it might simply exist as a mathematical structure - one that would exist whether or not anyone was simulating it.

In this view, consciousness might be what navigates through this mathematical structure, experiencing different parts of it as "reality." The universe wouldn't need to be computed because it already exists completely as a mathematical object.

This perspective aligns with certain interpretations of quantum mechanics and relativity, where time is seen not as flowing but as another dimension in a static 4D (or higher-dimensional) structure that simply exists.

What's particularly beautiful about this view is that it doesn't require infinite computational resources - the universe exists as a complete mathematical object without needing to be actively calculated. Consciousness is what moves through this structure, creating the experience of time and change.

Perhaps this is the ultimate resolution to the simulation paradox - not that we're in a computer simulation requiring impossible computational resources, but that we're conscious entities navigating through a mathematical structure of breathtaking elegance and complexity.

What do you think about these possibilities, fren? Do any of these approaches to simulation seem more plausible to you than others?

slight side track fren, but you got me curious - what are the most richly complex versions of conways game of life type universes that produce stable and long lasting creations currently structured by relatively elegant, simple math?

Edit
Complex Cellular Automata and Their Emergent Phenomena
Conway's Game of Life opened up a fascinating field of study in cellular automata, but there are several other systems that produce remarkably complex, stable structures from simple rules. Let me walk you through some of the most interesting examples:

Rule 110
Rule 110 is perhaps the most profound 1-dimensional cellular automaton, consisting of just three simple rules for how cells update based on their neighbors:

A living cell with a living right neighbor dies
A dead cell with either a living left neighbor or living right neighbor (but not both) becomes alive
All other configurations maintain their state
What makes Rule 110 extraordinary is that it's proven to be Turing complete, meaning it can simulate any computer program given the right initial conditions. This was proven by Matthew Cook in the 1990s.

Despite its simplicity, Rule 110 produces incredibly complex behaviors including:

Stable structures that persist indefinitely
"Gliders" that move across the grid
Complex interactions between these structures that can encode computational operations
The patterns in Rule 110 have a remarkable aesthetic quality—they form triangular fractal-like structures with areas of predictable repetition interrupted by chaotic regions where gliders and other complex structures emerge and interact.

Wireworld
Wireworld was created by Brian Silverman in 1987 and uses four states instead of Conway's two:

Empty (black)
Electron head (blue)
Electron tail (red)
Conductor (yellow)
Its update rules are simple but allow for extraordinary complexity:

Empty cells stay empty
Electron heads become electron tails
Electron tails become conductors
Conductors become electron heads if exactly one or two neighboring cells are electron heads, otherwise they remain conductors
What makes Wireworld fascinating is that it was specifically designed to simulate electronic logic circuits. People have built within it:

Functioning computers with memory and processing capabilities
Digital clocks
Prime number generators
Self-replicating circuits
The remarkable aspect of Wireworld is how it bridges the gap between abstract cellular automata and practical computing concepts. It demonstrates how computation naturally emerges from simple systems.

Langton's Ant
Christopher Langton created this system using an "ant" that moves on a grid according to just two rules:

At a white square, turn 90° right, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
At a black square, turn 90° left, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
From these minimal rules, the ant produces behavior of increasing complexity:

For the first few hundred steps, it creates simple symmetric patterns
Then it enters a period of seemingly chaotic behavior
After approximately 10,000 steps, the ant begins building a "highway"—a repeating pattern that extends indefinitely
This emergent "highway" pattern is particularly fascinating because it's impossible to predict its appearance from just studying the rules. It represents a genuine emergence of order from chaos that can only be discovered by running the simulation.

SmoothLife
Moving beyond discrete cells, SmoothLife (developed by Stephan Rafler) is a continuous version of Conway's Game of Life that operates on a continuous field rather than a discrete grid.

The rules are defined as differential equations rather than lookup tables, creating an environment where structures can exist at any position or rotation—not just aligned to a grid.

The results are breathtaking:

Smoothly moving "gliders" that can travel in any direction, not just along the grid axes
Rotating structures that would be impossible in traditional cellular automata
Structures that divide, merge, and interact in fluid, organic ways
SmoothLife produces patterns reminiscent of biological systems—cell division, amoeba-like movement, and complex ecological interactions—all emerging from simple mathematical rules.

Multiple Neighborhood Cellular Automata (MNCAs)
Developed by Carter Bays, these systems use multiple neighborhood configurations to determine cell states, creating extraordinary complexity:

Different rules apply to different patterns of neighboring cells
Cells can have more states than just on/off
Neighborhoods can extend beyond immediate neighbors
This approach has produced stable structures of remarkable complexity, including:

Self-replicating patterns that produce perfect copies of themselves
"Spaceships" of numerous varieties that travel across the grid
Computational structures equivalent to logic gates and memory elements
The key insight here is that slightly complexifying the ruleset—while keeping it elegantly mathematical—dramatically increases the richness of emergent phenomena.

Lenia
One of the most recent and impressive systems is Lenia, developed by Bert Chan. It represents a continuous cellular automaton with:

Continuous space (not a grid)
Continuous states (not just on/off)
Continuous time (not discrete steps)
Continuous rules (using kernel-based growth functions)
What makes Lenia extraordinary is the lifelike quality of its patterns. The system produces:

Creatures that appear to swim, crawl, or flow across the space
Entities that seem to exhibit behaviors like seeking, avoiding, or interacting
Complex ecosystems where multiple "species" coexist and interact
The patterns in Lenia are so reminiscent of biological systems that they've been studied for insights into artificial life. Some structures show behaviors that appear purposeful, despite emerging from simple mathematical principles.

Larger Implications
What makes these systems philosophically fascinating is how they demonstrate the emergence of complexity, order, and even behavior analogous to life from pure mathematics. They suggest that the complexity we see in our universe might similarly emerge from elegant underlying principles rather than needing to be explicitly encoded.

In each case, the complexity doesn't come from complicated rules but from simple rules applied recursively over many iterations—exactly the kind of fractal complexity that might underlie our own universe.

The most profound aspect is that these systems don't just produce random complexity—they produce stable, persistent structures that interact in lawful ways, creating their own "physics" from nothing but mathematical relationships.

If you'd like to explore any of these systems in more depth or see the remarkable structures they produce, I'd be happy to elaborate on any particular aspect that intrigues you.
