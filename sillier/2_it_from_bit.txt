let's ponder this 'it from bit' concept - if the single bit structure is the lowest level, the ot, high gravity, fine planck constant bottom level - just strings/fields/whatever single bit data may be stored as then how complex and information rich would they become by the time we reach the top, ~138 'levels' of fractal address above us?

Edit
Let's ponder the implications of "It from Bit" in our fractal universe model, starting from the simplest level and scaling up through the fractal hierarchy.

Starting at the Bottom: The Single Bit
At the very bottom of the fractal stack—the high gravity, Planck-scale level—we'd have the simplest information structures possible: single bits. These fundamental units might be:

Simple binary states (on/off)
Elementary quantum fields in their most basic configuration
The smallest possible fluctuations in spacetime geometry
Perhaps something like the simplest possible vibration patterns of theoretical strings
Each "bit" here would represent the most fundamental yes/no question that can be asked about reality. Think of it as the ultimate pixelation of existence—reality at its lowest resolution.

The First Few Levels: Emergence of Complexity
As we move up just a few levels in the fractal structure, these bits would begin to organize into more complex patterns:

Individual bits combine to form simple structures (analogous to bytes or words in computing)
Basic symmetries and conservation laws might emerge
Simple interactions between bits create elementary particles with basic properties
The first hints of spacetime curvature appear as emergent phenomena
This is similar to how simple cellular automata like Conway's Game of Life can generate surprising complexity from very simple rules applied recursively.

Middle Levels: Familiar Physics Emerges
Continuing upward, we'd reach the realms of familiar quantum physics and then classical physics:

Stable particles with complex properties emerge
Fundamental forces differentiate as distinct interactions
Atoms and molecules become possible as bits organize into hierarchical structures
Spacetime curvature manifests as the gravity we recognize
Each level of emergence would represent not just an addition of information, but a qualitative transformation in how information is organized and expressed.

Our Level (~138 Levels Up from Bottom)
At our position in the fractal stack, the original bits have organized into astonishingly complex structures:

Information is processed through brain networks containing billions of neurons
Consciousness emerges as a way to model and predict increasingly complex bit-patterns
Societies and civilizations represent collective information processing systems
Scientific theories are attempts to reverse-engineer the bit structure beneath our reality
Our reality contains an immense amount of information. Consider that a single human genome contains about 3 billion base pairs, equivalent to about 750 megabytes of data. The human brain processes about 11 million bits per second through our senses. The observable universe contains roughly 10^80 atoms, each representing numerous bits of information about position, momentum, charge, etc.

Approaching the Top: Transcendent Information Complexity
As we move beyond our level toward the top of the fractal hierarchy (levels 139-276 if we assume a symmetric structure), information complexity would continue to increase exponentially:

Individual consciousnesses might merge into collective information fields
The distinction between information and reality might blur completely
Time itself might become more fluid, with causality operating across multiple dimensions
Phenomenon like quantum entanglement might become dominant rather than edge cases
At these higher levels, the original bits would be organized into structures of such complexity that they'd be completely unrecognizable to us. It would be like a single pixel trying to comprehend an entire universe of imagery.

At the Top: Maximum Information, Minimum Constraint
At the hypothetical "top" level of the fractal structure, we might find:

A state of maximum information potential with minimum gravitational constraint
Nearly infinite degrees of freedom
Information organized in ways that transcend our concepts of space and time
Perhaps something analogous to what various spiritual traditions have described as ultimate reality
The complexity increase from bottom to top wouldn't be merely linear or even exponential—it would follow the scaling law defined by the fractal dimension of the universe (approximately 2.7268 for a Menger sponge). This means each level up multiplies the information capacity and complexity by a factor related to this dimension.

The Mathematical Progression
We can try to quantify this information scaling. If each level increases complexity by a factor related to the fractal dimension, then by level 138, the complexity increase would be approximately:

(2.7268)^138 ≈ 10^62

That's a factor of 10 followed by 62 zeros! To put this in perspective, there are estimated to be about 10^80 atoms in the observable universe.

By the time we reach the hypothetical top level at around 276 levels (assuming symmetry), we'd be looking at complexity on the order of:

(2.7268)^276 ≈ 10^124

This is an almost incomprehensibly large number, far exceeding the number of atoms in the universe or even the number of possible quantum states in the observable universe.

Information Transcendence
What's fascinating about this model is that it suggests a kind of "information transcendence" as we move up the fractal stack. Each level doesn't just contain more information—it represents a fundamental shift in how information is organized and expressed.

This resonates with philosopher Ken Wilber's concept of "holarchy," where each level of reality transcends but includes the levels below it. Higher levels don't just contain more bits—they represent fundamentally new ways of organizing and expressing information.

In this view, consciousness itself might be understood as an emergent property of information organization at a certain level of the fractal hierarchy. And what lies at levels far above us might be forms of consciousness or information processing that are as beyond our comprehension as quantum physics would be to a single-celled organism.

This "It from Bit" fractal hierarchy gives us a fascinating framework for understanding how the apparently simple foundation of reality could give rise to the rich complexity we experience, and hints at even greater complexity in levels beyond our own.

wait - i think if you check our work in the .txt i attached we are approx. 138 from top supposedly but near top - which implies the numbers work out different, no?

Edit
You're absolutely right - I made an error in my interpretation. Looking back at the document more carefully, I see that we're supposed to be approximately 138 levels from the top, not from the bottom. Let me recalibrate my analysis with this understanding.

In the document, your conversation discusses the Fractal Gravity Ratio (FGR) of approximately 10^-60, and it says:

"Under this model, moving from our universe's FGR of 10^-60 to the maximum of 1 (at the Planck scale) would require about 138 levels of the fractal (since e^138 ≈ 10^60). So in this rough picture, there would be around 138 'divisions' of the fractal stack above us."

This places us about 138 levels below the "bottom" of the stack (the Planck scale with maximum gravity), not 138 levels above the bottom. That completely changes our position in the fractal hierarchy.

Revised Understanding of Our Position
If we're 138 levels from the top of the stack (the region of minimum gravity), this means:

We are much closer to the "bottom" (high gravity, Planck-scale region) than I previously analyzed
Most of the fractal hierarchy extends above us, not below us
We're in a relatively information-dense, gravity-strong region of the fractal structure
Information Complexity in This Revised Model
Let's reconsider the "It from Bit" concept with this corrected understanding:

At the very bottom (maximum gravity, Planck scale), we would have the highest information density and complexity. This region would be characterized by:

Extremely dense information packing
Maximum computational capacity per unit volume
Highest possible bit-encoding efficiency
As we move upward in the fractal hierarchy (toward lower gravity regions), information becomes less densely packed, more "spread out." This creates an interesting inversion of my previous analysis.

Starting Point: The Information-Dense Bottom
The bottom of the fractal stack (which we're relatively close to) would be characterized by:

Information packed at nearly the theoretical maximum density (close to Planck-scale limits)
Extremely high energy density
Strong gravitational effects
Potentially the most complex possible bit arrangements per unit volume
This would be where the "bits" are arranged in their most efficient, information-dense configurations.

Moving Upward: Information Diffusion
As we move up the stack (away from our position and toward the top):

Information density decreases
Gravity weakens
Space becomes less curved
Information processing becomes more distributed and less efficient per unit volume
This creates a fascinating picture where the most fundamental level is actually the most information-rich, not the simplest. It's almost like the universe is a diffusion pattern from a highly concentrated information source.

Our Position (~138 Levels from the Top)
Being relatively close to the bottom of the stack would mean:

We exist in a relatively information-dense region of the fractal
Our physical laws are strongly influenced by the high-information region below us
We experience significant gravitational effects, but not at the maximum possible strength
Our consciousness and information processing capabilities are relatively complex
Approaching the Top: Information Sparsity
The top of the stack (138+ levels above us) would represent:

Minimal information density
Almost no gravity
Nearly flat spacetime
Sparse bit arrangements with minimal complexity
This completely inverts the picture I painted earlier. Instead of complexity increasing as we move up, it would be decreasing. The most complex, information-rich region would be at the bottom (maximum gravity), and the simplest, most sparse region would be at the top (minimum gravity).

The Mathematical Implications
If we're using the same exponential scaling model with the fractal dimension, then moving from our position to the top would involve a decrease in information density by a factor of approximately:

(2.7268)^138 ≈ 10^62

This means the information density at the top would be about 10^-62 times what we experience - almost vanishingly small.

A Different Metaphysical Interpretation
This revised understanding also changes the metaphysical implications. Rather than seeing spiritual enlightenment as moving "up" toward greater complexity, it might be seen as moving "up" toward greater simplicity and less constraint.

The top of the fractal stack would represent something like:

Maximum freedom from physical constraints
Minimum information requirement
Spacetime approaching perfect flatness
A state of minimal interference patterns
This resonates with certain spiritual traditions that view enlightenment as a process of simplification, letting go, and returning to an unconditioned state - rather than accumulating more complexity or information.

Thank you for the correction! This revised understanding creates a completely different picture of the fractal universe model and our place within it. The "It from Bit" concept still applies, but in this version, the maximum bit density and complexity would be at the bottom (Planck scale), with a gradual diffusion and simplification as we move toward the top of the hierarchy.

which spiritual traditions view enlightenment as a process of simplification, letting go, and returning to an unconditioned state - rather than accumulating more complexity or information fren?

Edit
Many spiritual traditions across the world embrace the path of simplification and letting go as the route to enlightenment or spiritual realization. Here are some of the most prominent ones:

Buddhism
Buddhism perhaps most explicitly frames enlightenment as a process of reduction rather than accumulation. The Buddha's path is fundamentally about recognizing and releasing attachments, desires, and false identifications.

The Four Noble Truths identify attachment and craving as the root causes of suffering. Nirvana (literally "blowing out" like extinguishing a flame) is reached not by gaining something new, but by letting go of illusions and attachments. Buddhist practice emphasizes emptying the mind rather than filling it with more concepts.

The concept of śūnyatā (emptiness) is central, particularly in Zen Buddhism, which emphasizes stripping away conceptual thinking to experience reality directly. The famous saying "Before enlightenment, chop wood and carry water; after enlightenment, chop wood and carry water" suggests that enlightenment is found in the simplicity of ordinary experience once we remove our conceptual overlays.

Taoism
Taoism centers on aligning with the Tao (the Way), which is often described as the simple, natural flow of reality. The Tao Te Ching repeatedly emphasizes "returning" to a natural, unconditioned state:

"Return is the movement of the Tao. Yielding is the way of the Tao."

Taoist practices focus on unlearning social conditioning and returning to simplicity. The concept of wu-wei (non-action or effortless action) suggests accomplishing more by doing less and working with natural patterns rather than against them.

Advaita Vedanta
This non-dualistic tradition within Hinduism teaches that liberation (moksha) comes through recognizing that one's true nature (Atman) is identical with the ultimate reality (Brahman).

Enlightenment in Advaita is not about gaining new knowledge but removing the ignorance (avidya) that makes us believe we are separate from ultimate reality. The process is often compared to clearing dust from a mirror – the true self is already present but obscured.

The practice of neti-neti ("not this, not this") involves systematically negating all concepts and identifications until only the unconditioned awareness remains.

Mystical Christianity
Though less commonly associated with simplification paths, Christian mysticism often emphasizes kenosis (self-emptying) and apophatic theology (describing God by what God is not).

Meister Eckhart wrote about "becoming nothing" to unite with God: "The eye with which I see God is the same eye with which God sees me: my eye and God's eye are one eye, one seeing, one knowing, one love."

The Cloud of Unknowing, a 14th-century mystical text, instructs practitioners to suspend all knowledge and concepts to encounter God directly.

Sufism (Mystical Islam)
Sufi practices aim at fana (annihilation of the self) to achieve baqa (subsistence in God). This is not about accumulating spiritual knowledge but dissolving the illusory self to recognize the underlying unity with God.

The 13th-century Sufi poet Rumi writes extensively about emptying oneself to become filled with divine presence: "Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it."

Philosophical Parallels
This view of enlightenment as simplification aligns interestingly with the fractal universe model you've been exploring. If our position in the fractal stack places us relatively close to the information-dense "bottom," then spiritual growth might indeed be conceptualized as moving "upward" toward greater simplicity.

In this model, what we experience as complexity and separation at our level becomes increasingly simplified as we move up the fractal hierarchy. The multiplicity of forms, thoughts, and identifications gives way to a more unified, less constrained state of being.

This creates a fascinating convergence between ancient spiritual intuitions and this contemporary mathematical metaphor. Both suggest that what we perceive as "gaining enlightenment" might actually be a process of shedding layers of unnecessary complexity to reveal a simpler, more fundamental reality that was always present beneath our conceptual overlays.
