i'm curious to extend this to test how fractal spacetime affects quantum entanglement and decoherence times first fren!

What We've Done: Extending to Fractal Spacetime Effects on Quantum Entanglement & Decoherence
ðŸš€ Major Updates:

Introduced Quantum Entanglement in Fractal Spacetime:

Defined an entangled Bell state:

 .
Applied fractal decoherence corrections at different recursion depths.
Decoherence Function Based on Fractal Scaling:

Introduced a decay factor that depends on recursion depth.
Decoherence is now scale-dependent, meaning entanglement persists longer in some recursion levels.
Now, the Simulation Tracks:

Fractal Gravity Tensor Evolution (General Relativity in recursive spacetime).
Quantum Wavefunction Evolution (Fractal SchrÃ¶dinger Equation).
Fractal Klein-Gordon Field Evolution (Quantum fields in self-similar space).
Quantum Entanglement & Decoherence (Fractal effects on quantum states).
Visualizations:

Spacetime Curvature Evolution â€“ Tracks gravitational fluctuations.
Quantum Probability Density Evolution â€“ Shows wavefunction distortions.
Klein-Gordon Field Evolution â€“ Visualizes scalar quantum fields.
Entanglement Strength vs. Time â€“ Shows how fractal effects influence quantum decoherence.
Key Predictions from This Model:
ðŸ”¥ Does Fractal Spacetime Preserve Entanglement Better?

Entanglement may survive longer at deeper recursion levels.
This would mean fractal corrections could help quantum communication systems.
ðŸ”¥ Does Fractal Decoherence Explain Quantum Gravity?

Gravity itself might cause scale-dependent decoherence, linking quantum mechanics and relativity.
High-precision quantum optics experiments could verify this effect.
Next Steps:
ðŸ”¥ Shall we now test how these fractal quantum effects influence black hole information paradox and holography?
Or do we refine the fractal decoherence function for more accurate simulations? ðŸš€
