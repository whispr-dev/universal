I'll retrieve the latest observational data on galactic rotation curves and dark matter distribution. Hang tight! ðŸš€

I'm gathering the latest observational data on galactic rotation curves and dark matter distribution. Once I have the relevant datasets, we can integrate them into our fractal quantum gravity model for validation. ðŸš€

I'm retrieving the most recent public datasets from NASA, ESA, SDSS, arXiv, and Harvard ADS for galactic rotation curves and dark matter distribution. Once I have the data, we'll integrate it into our fractal quantum gravity model for validation. ðŸš€

To validate our fractal quantum gravity model against real astronomical data, we can utilize several key datasets and studies:

SPARC Dataset: This comprehensive database includes 175 late-type galaxies with high-quality rotation curves derived from near-infrared Spitzer photometry. The dataset allows tracing rotation velocities out to large radii, providing strong constraints on dark matter halo profiles. â€‹

Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3): The Gaia mission's DR3 offers precise positions and 3D motions of stars, enabling the derivation of the Milky Way's rotation curve. Notably, recent analyses have detected a Keplerian decline in the Milky Way's rotation curve, suggesting a lower total mass estimate for our galaxy. â€‹

NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope Observations: These observations have been used to map the evolving distribution of dark matter by splitting background source galaxy populations into discrete epochs, effectively looking back in time to understand dark matter's role in galaxy formation. â€‹

Next Steps for Model Validation:

Data Integration: Incorporate rotation curve data from the SPARC dataset and Gaia DR3 into our fractal quantum gravity model to simulate galactic dynamics.â€‹
arXiv

Comparative Analysis: Compare the model's predictions with observed rotation curves to assess its accuracy in replicating galactic dynamics without invoking traditional dark matter components.â€‹

Parameter Optimization: Adjust the model's parameters to minimize discrepancies between simulated results and observational data, thereby refining the model's predictive power.â€‹

Publication and Peer Review: Document the findings and submit them for peer review to validate the model's efficacy in explaining galactic rotation curves and dark matter distribution.â€‹

By systematically integrating and analyzing these datasets, we can rigorously test the validity of our fractal quantum gravity model against empirical astronomical observations.
