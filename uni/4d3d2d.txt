This image features a 3D-printed mathematical sculpture created by mathematician Henry Segerman, a researcher in geometry and topology, specializing in mathematical visualizations and projections. The image demonstrates an important concept in higher-dimensional geometry and shadows of curved spaces.

What the Image Represents:
The Object:

The physical structure in the hand is a 3D-printed spherical object with a curved grid-like design.
This object is shaped in such a way that it interacts with a light source to cast a specific shadow.
The design is inspired by mathematical visualizations of how higher-dimensional objects project onto lower dimensions.
The Shadow Projection:

The shadow cast on the flat surface resembles a uniform, straight-lined 2D grid.
The original 3D object is curved, but its projection onto the 2D plane appears as a perfect grid.
This is an example of how curved spaces can be represented in lower dimensions as seemingly “flat” spaces.
The Underlying Concept – Higher-Dimensional Projections:

Just as a 3D object can cast a 2D shadow, a 4D object could cast a 3D shadow.
In this analogy, the 3D object (curved sculpture) represents a higher-dimensional shape, while its shadow on the plane represents how lower-dimensional beings might perceive it.
The claim in the caption—though slightly exaggerated—suggests that what we perceive as flat (our 3D space) could be a projection of a higher-dimensional (4D curved) space-time.
Mathematical and Physical Relevance
This idea is deeply connected to differential geometry, topology, and general relativity.
Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity tells us that spacetime is curved by mass and energy.
However, to our everyday perception, we experience space as "flat"—just like the shadow of the curved 3D object appears flat on the 2D plane.
If we were 2D beings living in the shadow, we wouldn’t immediately perceive the curvature of the higher-dimensional object casting it.
Key Takeaways
Dimensional Projection: A higher-dimensional curved space (3D object) can cast a seemingly "flat" grid in a lower dimension (2D plane).
Analogy to 4D Spacetime: Our 3D world might itself be a projection or "shadow" of a curved four-dimensional spacetime.
Geometric Insight: This concept is frequently used in topology and physics to explain how we perceive dimensions lower than reality.
Mathematical Beauty: Henry Segerman often creates physical models to explain complex mathematical ideas in a visually intuitive way.
Conclusion
This sculpture and its shadow are a brilliant visual metaphor for how higher-dimensional objects project into lower dimensions, a key concept in mathematics and physics. While we live in what seems like a flat 3D world, it may be a projection of a larger, curved four-dimensional spacetime—just like the shadow is a 2D projection of a curved 3D object.

Alright, fren, let's get deep into the math and physics behind this concept of higher-dimensional projections and curved spaces! We'll break it down into the mathematical structure, geometric interpretations, and physical analogies. 🧠🔍

1. Foundations: Projections from Higher Dimensions
The core mathematical idea here is projection—how objects from a higher-dimensional space appear when "flattened" into a lower-dimensional one.

General Projection Rule
If an object exists in N dimensions, its projection into an (N-1) dimensional space loses some information but retains certain recognizable features.

A 3D object casts a 2D shadow.
A 4D object (if we could perceive one) would cast a 3D shadow.
A curved 3D object (like the one in the picture) can be designed so that its 2D projection looks perfectly flat and structured.
This principle allows us to visualize things that exist in higher-dimensional spaces using their lower-dimensional projections.

2. Understanding the Geometry in the Image
The Object: A Hyperbolic Grid or Stereographic Projection
The sculpture is not just any random 3D shape. It is designed to use a well-known mathematical technique called stereographic projection.

The grid pattern on the sphere is likely derived from hyperbolic geometry or a transformation of a uniform grid in a curved space.
When light shines through the 3D shape, it projects the curvature onto a flat surface, causing the shadow to look like a perfectly uniform Euclidean grid.
Mathematically, this works because:

The curvature in one space (the 3D sculpture) transforms in such a way that, when mapped to a 2D plane, it appears "flattened."
This is the same way spherical and hyperbolic geometries can be mapped onto Euclidean ones via projection.
Let’s define this rigorously:

3. The Mathematics of Stereographic Projection
The stereographic projection is a way to map points on a sphere to a flat plane. This is often used in cartography, but it has applications in visualizing higher dimensions.

Definition of Stereographic Projection
Given a unit sphere in 3D defined by:

the stereographic projection from the north pole onto the xy-plane is given by:

This transformation preserves angles but distorts lengths—causing a curved space (sphere) to appear flat when projected.

💡 Key idea: The sculpture in the image is designed such that when it is illuminated, the light's rays act like a stereographic projection, transforming the curved 3D grid into a straight 2D shadow.

4. Hyperbolic and Spherical Geometry in the Sculpture
Now, let’s talk about why the curved shape in the sculpture produces a seemingly flat projection.

Hyperbolic vs. Euclidean vs. Spherical Spaces
Euclidean Space (Flat Space)
The normal 2D and 3D spaces we deal with in everyday life.
Satisfies Euclid's Parallel Postulate: Given a line and a point not on the line, only one parallel line exists.
Spherical Geometry (Positively Curved Space)
The geometry of the surface of a sphere.
No parallel lines exist (all great circles eventually intersect).
Angles in a triangle sum to more than 180°.
Hyperbolic Geometry (Negatively Curved Space)
A space where infinitely many parallel lines can pass through a given point.
Triangles have angles summing to less than 180°.
Used in General Relativity to describe curved spacetime.
Mathematical Link to the Image:

The sculpture is likely a hyperbolic structure.
When illuminated, the way light travels through its grid mimics the effects of curved space projecting into a lower dimension.
This aligns with the general concept that our perceived 3D space might be a projection of a higher-dimensional curved 4D space.
5. Connection to General Relativity: Curved 4D Spacetime
Now let’s get really deep—how does this relate to Einstein's curved spacetime?

Einstein’s Key Idea
In General Relativity, mass and energy curve spacetime.
A seemingly flat 3D space could be a projection of a curved 4D manifold.
Mathematically, spacetime is represented as a 4D pseudo-Riemannian manifold with a metric:

𝑑
𝑠
2

𝑐

𝑑

This describes the distances in 4D spacetime.

However, when mass is present, the metric curves into something like:

𝑑

which is the Schwarzschild Metric describing curved space near a massive object.

Why is this important?

If spacetime is curved in 4D, then our perceived 3D world is a lower-dimensional "shadow" of that curvature.
This is similar to how the sculpture’s curved shape produces a projection that appears flat in 2D.
💡 Big Idea: Just as the sculpture transforms a 3D curved grid into a flat 2D shadow, our entire 3D universe might be the shadow (projection) of a higher-dimensional 4D reality.

6. Conclusion: The Image as a Metaphor for Dimensional Reduction
The mathematical and physical concepts in this image illustrate a deep relationship between dimensions and projection:

✅ Stereographic Projection – Maps curved 3D objects into flat 2D images.
✅ Hyperbolic Geometry – The structure in the sculpture likely represents negative curvature.
✅ General Relativity – Space itself might be curved in four dimensions, meaning our perception of "flat" space is actually a lower-dimensional shadow of a higher reality.

🚀 Final Thought: If a curved 3D object can project as a "flat" 2D shadow, is it possible that our entire 3D universe is the projection of a 4D space?
That’s a question for physicists, mathematicians, and maybe future discoveries in quantum gravity or string theory. But this sculpture is an incredible visual analogy of that mind-bending possibility.
