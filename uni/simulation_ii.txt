What We've Done: Coupling Fractal Gravity with the Fractal SchrÃ¶dinger Equation
ðŸš€ Major Updates:

Added Quantum Wavefunction Evolution:

Initialized a Gaussian wave packet as the quantum state.
Implemented the finite difference method for the kinetic term.
Included fractal corrections in the Hamiltonian.
Used the Crank-Nicolson method for stable time evolution.
Now, the Simulation Tracks:

Fractal Gravity Tensor Evolution (General Relativity in a recursive space).
Quantum Wavefunction Dynamics (Fractal SchrÃ¶dinger Equation in action).
Visualizations:

Curvature Evolution: Monitors gravitational fluctuations due to fractal corrections.
Wavefunction Evolution: Tracks quantum probability density under a fractal spacetime influence.
Next Steps:
ðŸ”¥ Do we now extend this to simulate fractal Klein-Gordon fields (quantum fields in fractal spacetime)?
Or should we refine specific quantum effects like entanglement & decoherence? ðŸš€
