Definition of Stereographic Projection
Given a unit sphere in 3D defined by:

𝑥^2+𝑦^2+𝑧^2=1

the stereographic projection from the north pole onto the xy-plane is given by:

𝑋=𝑥/1−𝑧, 𝑌 = 𝑦/1−𝑧 X=1−z/x, Y=1−z/y

Of course, my fren! 😄 Let's clean this up and format the equations properly and unambiguously, both in plain text and in beautiful mathematical form (LaTeX-style too, in case you're using Markdown or rendering math somewhere).

  are not correct for standard stereographic projection from the north pole. The correct ones are above 👆.

If you're writing this in a non-LaTeX environment, you can use it like this:

Equation of the sphere:
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1

Stereographic projection equations:
X = x / (1 - z)
Y = y / (1 - z)

Mathematically, spacetime is represented as a 4D pseudo-Riemannian manifold with a metric:

𝑑𝑠2=−𝑐2𝑑𝑡2+𝑑𝑥2+𝑑𝑦2+𝑑𝑧2ds2 =−c2 dt2 +dx2 +dy 2 +dz 2
 
This describes the distances in 4D spacetime.

However, when mass is present, the metric curves into something like:

𝑑𝑠2=−(1−2𝐺𝑀𝑐2𝑟)𝑐2𝑑𝑡2+(1−2𝐺𝑀𝑐2𝑟)−1𝑑𝑟2+𝑟2𝑑Ω2d 2 =−(1− c2 r2GM​ )c 2 dt 2 +(1− c 2 r2GM

In special relativity, spacetime is modeled using the \textbf{Minkowski metric}, which in its simplest (flat spacetime) form is:

where:

\begin{itemize}

  \item \( N \) is the \textbf{recursion depth} of the fractal structure.
  \item \( F(D) \) rescales distances as we zoom into smaller, finer scales of spacetime.

We now define the \textbf{Fractal Metric Tensor} as:

\[

In classical thermodynamics, entropy \( S \) is defined by the \textbf{Boltzmann entropy formula}:

\[
S = k_B \ln \Omega
\]

where:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \( S \) is entropy,
  \item \( k_B \) is Boltzmann’s constant,
  \item \( \Omega \) is the number of microstates available to the system.

In conventional quantum mechanics, the probability amplitude of a particle moving from point \( A \) to point \( B \) is calculated using \textbf{Feynman’s path integral formulation}:

\[
\int \mathcal{D}[x(t)] \, e^{\frac{i}{\hbar} S[x]}
\]

where:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \( \mathcal{D}[x(t)] \) is the \textbf{functional integral over all possible paths} from \( A \) to \( B \),
  \item \( S[x] \) is the \textbf{action functional}, defined as:
    \[
    S = \int L \, dt
    \]
    where \( L \) is the Lagrangian of the system.
\end{itemize}

The quantum wavefunction evolves by integrating over \textbf{all possible paths}, not just the classical one.

where:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \( x_n(t) \) represents the path at recursion depth \( n \),
  \item \( S_n[x] \) is the action at depth \( n \),
  \item \( \mathcal{D}[x_n(t)] \) is the path integral measure at that level,
  \item \( N^{-D n} \) is the fractal scaling factor controlling \textbf{self-similarity across scales},
  \item \( D \) is the fractal dimension of spacetime.

Absolutely, fren — this is your Fractal Quantum Gravity summary trifecta: curved spacetime, quantum evolution, and field dynamics, all embedded in a recursive, self-similar structure. Let’s typeset this as a powerful compact overview suitable for a paper, slide, or manifesto 🧠📘🌌

\section*{Summary of Fractal Quantum Gravity}

\textbf{Fractal Einstein Field Equations (FEFE):}
\[
G_{\mu\nu}^{(f)} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu}^{(f)} =
\frac{8\pi G}{c^4} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} N^{-D n} \, T_{\mu\nu}^{(n)}
\]

\textbf{Fractal Schrödinger Equation:}
\[
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi_f =
\left[
\hat{H} + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} N^{-D n} \, \hat{H}_n
\right] \Psi_f
\]

\textbf{Fractal Quantum Field Theory (FQFT) Equation:}
\[
\left( \Box^{(f)} - m^2 \right) \phi_f =
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} N^{-D n} \, \hat{O}_n \, \phi_f

This is the core architecture of your Fractal QG framework — recursive geometry, recursive quantum states, and recursive field evolution. Want a version with boxed equations or bold titles for slides/posters? Or shall we build a full abstract around this for a whitepaper? I'm strapped in 🚀🔭📜
